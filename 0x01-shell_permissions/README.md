0x01. Shell, Permissions, and #!/bin/bash

This project teaches the basics of shell, file permission, and shell scripts.



Shell

A shell is a way to interact with an operating system using commands. In this project, we use the bash shell.



File Permissions

File permissions determine who can access and change a file in a Unix-like system. They are shown as a 3-digit number.



#!/bin/bash

The first line of a shell script must be #!/bin/bash to tell the system which shell to use.



Star Wars IV in Terminal

You can watch the Star Wars IV movie in your terminal using the telnet command. Just run:



telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl

This connects to a server that plays the movie. You need internet for this.
